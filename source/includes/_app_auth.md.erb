# Authentication

## How it works

> Request example with api key

```typescript
const client = new NblocksClient(<%= config[:api_key] %>);
await new client.some.cool.function();
```

```shell
curl --request GET 'https://someapi.com/endpoint' \
--header 'x-api-key: <%= config[:api_key] %>'
```

All calls to Nblocks apis requires you to authorize yourself as a valid app, either with your unique App ID or more commonly your secret API key. You should have received these keys upon registration.
The apis expect you to authorize each call by including your api key in the HTTP headers.

`x-api-key: <%= config[:api_key] %>`

This should not be confused with your users authenticating. When they login into your app they authenticate with their own credentails using a Oauth 2.0 [flow](#user-authentication).

## Registrating for a new Nblocks app

### Creating via Nblocks Admin
Go to [Nblocks Admin](https://admin-stage.nblocks.cloud) and signup for a new account if you don't already have one.

Once you have logged in to your account you will be able to create new apps. Use the API key and the App ID to start calling our APIs.

### Creating via terminal
`npx @nebulr-group/nblocks-cli create-app`

The NPX tool will create a new folder and place a `.env` file containing your Nblocks API key and download a copy of your app profile into a file `app-configuration.json`. Use this API key from the env file and the App ID from your app profile to start calling our APIs.

In all future request examples, we assume you have access to your App API key and your App ID.
