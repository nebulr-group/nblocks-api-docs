# Feature flags
Feature flags allows you to conditionally give access to or show / hide features or content to your users.

To use feature flags you must first create **Flags** and link them with **Segments**. 
Then you can start making **Evaluation** calls where you provide the current **[Context](#feature-flags-evaluation-context)** and the API will take care of matching the context with the segments and returns if the flag is enabled or not.

Some use cases for feature flags are:

- Restrict access to premium content that just users with a certain plan can access
- Try beta features on a selection of customers
- Show a message to all users during a scheduled release.
